The customized R scripts for the two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using the TwoSampleMR package is available in a GitHub repository. Requests should be directed to the corresponding author at [email@institution.edu] and will be fulfilled within 4 weeks. The scripts include implementations for:  
- Genetic instrument selection (p-value < 5×10-8 or 5×10-6, clumping r² < 0.001)  
- MR core analyses (inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger regression, Weighted median, Weighted mode)  
- Sensitivity analyses (Cochran's Q test, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out)
